In Gitbash:

-> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mahalakshmi180901@gmail.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_pra
-> paraprash empty
->paraphrase again empty

The above three steps will creates the ssh key for repository for a particular account

check the ssh is created by the coomand below
->ls ~/.ssh

if we directly try to add ssh key it will show this
->Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.

and to add the ssh key the command is as follows
-> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_pra

to overcome this error Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
-> eval `ssh-agent -s` 
the above command should be executed before adding ssh key.
and it will give some thing like this 
Agent pid 1703

now we can proceed with adding ssh key by 
-> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_pra
it will give some thing like this Identity added: /c/Users/Mahalakshmi.M/.ssh/id_pra (mahalakshmi180901@gmail.com)


we need to get ssh key to add ssh key to repository. To get ssh key, the command is as follows
-> cat ~/.ssh/id_pra
this command will give some thing like this
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
Note: not exactly the same private key it will be different for you and different for each repository as well.


and now to make this ssh key small we use .pub file and command goes as follows
->cat ~/.ssh/id_pra.pub
and this will give some thing like this
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIBZ5bANiWClhDDJOTjjWpH4ziotKkUWGJVGRWVcnUEIo mahalakshmi180901@gmail.com
Note: not exactly the same private key it will be different for you and different for each repository as well.


now we need to take this ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIBZ5bANiWClhDDJOTjjWpH4ziotKkUWGJVGRWVcnUEIo mahalakshmi180901@gmail.com
ssh key and add to your repository of your account and use the ssh key to clone the repo.

after add . -> use git config user.name "Mahalakshmi"
	    -> git config user.email "mahalakshmi180901@gmail.com"
Note: if your username is different to email.
